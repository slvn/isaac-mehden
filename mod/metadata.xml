    <description>Welcome to the worst possible Eden:
- All stats are the minimum Eden could have
- Start with a bunch of bad starters

Why?
- Mehden is a tool to train for Eden streaking by simulating bad starters.


This is an alpha, it might not work at all, please just send me feedback on my discord and we'll fix everything discord.gg/B8qyqrXfcR
